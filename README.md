# Text Decorator

Part of [Concord Consortium's](https://concord.org) Glossary Plugin package which applies appropriate `<span>` tags and classes to application text to support the glossary.

This project was created using the [TypeScript Library Starter](https://github.com/alexjoverm/typescript-library-starter#readme) project, whose local [README](README-typescript-library-starter) provides additional information about the configuration of the project.
